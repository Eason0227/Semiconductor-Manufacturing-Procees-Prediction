Semiconductor Manufacturing  Prediction  
Dataset from UCI Secom dataset  
SECOM Dataset: 1567 examples 591 features, 104 fails  

Semiconductor manufacturing processes are often monitored by signals/variables collected from sensors or process measurement points, we treat each type of signal as a feature, apply feature selection to identify the most critical signals, and finally predict based on these features Product success or failure.
